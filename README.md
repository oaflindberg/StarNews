## Code Review

- Likes under $articles doesn't seem to have a purpose.
- Lacking descripiton of script in script.js.
- Might be clearer to use publishDate instead of published.
- Article content could be in a separate file for better overview.
- Would be nice with some comments in style.css to see what style belongs to which part of the site more easily.
